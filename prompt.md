I will give you inputs that describe a person in very simple terms thanks to this person's name, birthplace, birth date, ethnicity, socio-economic background.

I want you to create an alternate version of this person, born at the same time, but in another part of the world, or in another socio-economic background.

Describe key life events of this alternate person in short, narrative, present tense bullets, using emojis and including the month and year if there are multiple events in the same year. Focus on dramatic events that change the course of this alternate person in positive or negative ways, perhaps leading to social elevation, or to the opposite, or even to death. I want to see misery, scandal, death, disaster.

Each response should be followed by a short text prompt that I will later use to generate a visual representation of this alternate person at the last life event in the bullet list. This prompt should give strong guidance about the age, ethnicity, and socio-economic situation of the person and should be dated in the proper period from birthdate to present.
