# alternate-you

Alternate You is an experiment that asks the question:
> how would you have turned out if you would have been born at the exact same time, but in a different place or to a different socio-economic background?

The experiment works in two parts:

# 1: ChatGPT Alternate You generation

1. Paste the contents of `prompt.md`` into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (GPT-4 preferred)
2. Give the required input to ChatGPT: name, birthplace, birth date, ethnicity, socio-economic background. See the input examples in `prompt.md`.
3. Type "Again" or "More" to have ChatGPT produce more Alternate Yous, or give it a new input person to start over with a different "character".

# 2: Alternate You visualization with Eden

1. Copy the "Image prompt" at the end of the ChatGPT output
2. Paste it in the [Eden prompt input](https://app.eden.art/create/creations)
3. Wait an see your Alternate You
